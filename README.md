# Heart Disease Prediction App

This repository contains a Streamlit web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data. The machine learning model used in this app is trained on the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) and predicts the probability of heart disease based on various input features.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction

 ## Usage
Once the Streamlit app is running, open your web browser and go to (http://localhost:8501) (or the URL provided by Streamlit in the terminal). You will see a form where you can input patient details such as age, sex, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. After filling in the required information, click the Predict button to see the model's prediction for heart disease.

## Features
Input Fields
The app includes the following input fields for predicting heart disease:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Fasting blood sugar
Resting electrocardiographic results
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise-induced angina
ST depression induced by exercise
Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia type
Prediction
The app predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on the input data using a pre-trained machine learning model.
